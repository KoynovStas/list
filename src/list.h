 * Node - a data structure (payloads) in which one of the fields is
 * a variable of type list_head.
 *
 * example:
 *
 * struct tmp_data
 * {
 *    struct list_head list;
 *    int              data;
 * };
 *
 *
 * node* - a pointer to a Node, which is a pointer == pointer to
 * member (list_head) within the struct of data.
 *
 * If a member(list_head) in data structure (payloads) is
 * the first member (offset == 0) then the Node* == node*
 *
 * To get pointer to data structure(payloads), if you have a pointer to a node,
 * use the function: list_data
 *
